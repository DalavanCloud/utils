# API

*NOTES*
* These API docs are still being written. However, we have attempted to stick to the Ramda signature as much as possible for our data methods. So, in most cases, the [ramda documentation](https://ramdajs.com/docs/) is a good point of reference.
* A number of our data methods have async support built in. They will automatically upgrade to async methods when an async iteratee is used.
